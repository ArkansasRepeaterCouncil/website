		<h2>Principles</h2>
		<p>
Frequency coordination exists for the purpose of reducing or eliminating interference between
Amateur Repeaters. In Arkansas, the Arkansas Repeater Council, Inc., (ARC), is the recognized
Coordinator.
		</p><p>
Frequency Coordination is voluntary. By obtaining coordination, you avail yourself the
Protection of the FCC if there is a problem between your repeater and an uncoordinated
repeater. The uncoordinated machine is responsible for correcting the problem, not you.
</p><p>
The ARC adheres to Regional (MACC) and National (NFCC) standards of coordination.
This requires working with other states to prevent interference to everyone. Since the different
organizations are voluntary, not everybody replies promptly. The ARC tries to provide
coordination within a sixty-day time frame. This time frame starts from the date of receipt by the
Coordinator, till responses from surrounding states that are affected by the coordination and
notification is sent back to the repeater owner or trustee. If a coordination response is not
received, the coordinator advises the state involved that the coordination is proceeding without
their input.
</p><p>
Proper completion of the application form speeds up the coordinating process. If there is a
change in the application during the coordination, the new information should be submitted
as soon as possible to the coordinator. After the coordination is completed and the repeater is on the air, ANY change in the operating parameters (transmit power, antenna height, ERP,
location or frequency) outside the published specifications, the coordination is automatically
void and the frequency will be returned to the pool for reassignment. 
</p><p>
Deviation limits are as follows:
Power - No more than 5 watts from coordinated power (at duplexer output)
Ant. Height - No more than +50 ft. from coordinated height
ERP - 300 Watts maximum
Location - Not more than 1 mile in any direction from coordinated location
Frequency - No changes without re-coordination
</p><p>
If a frequency is not used or has stopped being used, the coordination will be voided 15 days
after receipt of notification to the repeater owner or trustee that this action will be taken unless
the repeater is put back into service. This action insures that frequencies remain available as
much as possible. 
</p><p>
After a constuction permit has been issued by the coordinator, the applicant has 180 days to
complete the repeater installation and notify the coordinator that the repeater is operational,
after which the coordinator will issue a Completion Notice. If problems arise and more than 180
days are required, then the coordinator must be notified to request an extension of 60 days.
</p><p>
Coordination is voluntary and depends on you to help keep interference to a minimum.
When interference occurs between two coordinated repeaters, the ARC will work with all parties
involved to try and resolve the problem to everyone's satisfaction. The FCC has final jurisdiction
on any and all complaints.
</p><p>
The ARC charges a minimal fee for coordination to offset mailing and telephone charges.
The non-refundable fee is $10.00. ARC Members pay $5.00
Currently, fees for coordination have been suspended unless the Council Funds drop below a
pre-set level. 
</p><p>
If for some reason coordination cannot be provided at the time of submission, the application
will be held for two years. If a frequency become available within that time, the application will
be processed with no additional cost.

		<h2>Guidelines</h2>
		The ARC requires records of all systems every 3 years.
		<h3>Band plans</h3>
The member state coordinators shall adhere as closely as possible to the use of the various
band plans as adopted by the Mid-America Coordination Council.
Use of the modified band plans is at the option of the local State coordinators with the consent of adjacent MACC state coordinators.
		<h3>Geographical separation of repeaters</h3>
The minimum geographical spacing between the two closest points of the systems in question
shall be 90 miles (effective 03-02-2013 per vote at annual membership meeting).
This spacing is considered valid for systems on the 52, 144, 220, 440, 902 and
1215 MHz bands. This applies to separations in and out of the state.
		<h3>Adjacent frequency separation</h3>

		<h3>Miscellaneous specifications &amp; definitions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Closed repeater - applications will be coordinated as SNP repeaters.</li>
			<li>Portable repeater - a repeater which can be placed on a location 72 hours before and after
      an event. The repeater may be a coordinated repeater. It may also be set up for an emergency. It must stay within state boundaries.</li>
			<li>Temporary repeater - a repeater that had a site failure (fallen tower, fire, etc.). It can be
      moved up to 25 miles from it's coordinated site for no more than 30 days. An extension can
      be granted by the coordinator upon request by the repeater owner / trustee. After repairs are
      completed, the repeater must be returned to its coordinated site within 72 hours. </li>

	<section>
		<h2>Procedures</h2>
		Any individual or organization desiring to establish a repeater system should first make a
request for coordination, in writing, to the Arkansas Repeater Council, Inc. (ARC).
		
		<h3>Application procedure</h3>

Upon receipt of an Application for Coordination, the ARC Coordinator shall attempt, within 60 days, to process the application and respond to the applicant. In the event the application is DENIED, the 
Coordinator shall include an explanation of the DENIAL and outline possible alternatives to the
applicant.
		
		<h3>Repeater Construction Period</h3>
		Upon approval of a request for coordination, a period of 180 days is allowed to place the repeater into operation. Operation is defined as "fully tested repeater operation from the final repeater location or site". If the system is not in operation after this construction period, the coordination is automatically
withdrawn. If however, during this 180 day period, the applicant determines that he will be unable to place the repeater on the assigned frequency into operation, he may request an extension of no more than 60 days. If the construction and Installation of the repeater system is not completed within this 
extended period, the frequency assignment is automatically withdrawn. The applicant may then re-apply for the coordination, but there is no guarantee that the previously coordinated frequency will be available.
This allows for efficient use of valuable spectrum and ensures that frequency pairs are not wasted by holding assignments for protracted periods when applicants fail to construct in a timely manner.
The applicant must notify the Coordinator in writing at the time the repeater is placed into regular
service for the applicant to retain coordination.
If a previously constructed repeater system is rendered inoperative for more than 60 days, the Sponsor must notify the Coordinator, in writing, of the failure of the system. The Sponsor will have 90 days to return the repeater system to the air. The sponsor will notify the coordinator, in writing, of the date the system is returned to operation.
		
		<h3>Modification to existing coordination</h3>

Any modification or change in the original coordination (i.e.- TX Power, Ant. Height, ERP, Location or Frequency) will automatically void the coordination. Deviations allowed are set forth in the Coordination Guidelines, however the coordinator must be notified within 30 days of any "allowed" changes. 
If a repeater is to be moved from its coordinated location, the sponsor of the system must file a new "coordination Application". The sponsor must clearly state on the application that it includes a "request for relocation". Upon receipt of the application, the request will be reviewed. The coordinator will
confirm that the proposed change in location meets all the criteria set forth in the Coordination Guidelines.
If it is determined that the proposed relocation of the repeater will not conform to the applicable coordination guidelines, the application for relocation will not be granted. The Coordinator must reply in writing within (60) days of receipt of request. Under NO circumstances will the Sponsor begin operation of the repeater system prior to receiving an approval of the "change of location" from the Coordinator.
		
		<h3>Transfer of coordinated frequencies</h3>

A frequency coordination may be transferred under certain conditions. If a coordinated repeater system
that is currently in complete operation is sold, the Sponsorship will transfer with the repeater system.
Any such sale or transfer must include the actual equipment that comprises the repeater system. Both the original sponsor and the new sponsor must sign an agreement to transfer the coordination and
forward a copy to the coordinator within (30) days. As the SPONSOR, not the TRUSTEE, holds the
coordination of any given frequency, any change in the trustee of any coordinated repeater will not be
grounds for the revocation of a frequency coordination. The Coordinator must, however, be notified in
writing of a change in trusteeship within (60) days.
